        filename (str, optional): The path to the known_hosts file. Defaults to

                `BasePaths.KNOWN_HOSTS`.

        This constructor calls the superclass constructor (`HostKeys.__init__`)

        Args:
            hostname (str): The hostname of the key to remove.

        This method attempts to remove the specified `hostname` from the known_hosts
        file. It first checks if the key exists using `self.lookup(hostname)`. If the
        key is found, it executes the `ssh-keygen` command with the following arguments:

        - `-f`: Specifies the known_hosts file path.
        - `-R`: Instructs `ssh-keygen` to remove the key for the given hostname.

        **Note:** This method does not explicitly raise an error if the key is not found.
        It's recommended to check the return value of `self.lookup(hostname)` before
        calling `remove` to handle the case where the key doesn't exist.

        Returns:
            None
