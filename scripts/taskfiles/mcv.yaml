# The mcv project is a meta project that contains all the other projects for export to a new system
# In the event the target system is a different OS, or a different architecture, the mcv project will

# TODO: Is this the main project or a convenient distillation for local transfers to containers?
# TODO: Or is all of the above as a backup service?
